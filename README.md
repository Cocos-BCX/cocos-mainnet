Cocos-BCX is the next generation gaming digital economy platform. The project aims to provide game developers with an easy-to-use, comprehensive blockchain gaming infrastructure. Provide gamers with a transparent, fair, and open game environment. The underlying chain system is based on graphene for the optimization of consensus mechanisms and the addition of intelligent contract systems. And provide a lot of game features, such as random number, contract session mechanism, timer, and heartbeat.  


# Getting Started  
## Preparation  

We recommend building on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (64-bit)
```  
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install autoconf cmake git vim libbz2-dev libdb++-dev libdb-dev
libssl-dev openssl libreadline-dev libtool libcurl4-openssl-dev libboost-all-dev
```  


## Building the source  
```  
cmake -DBUILD_PROCESS_ENCRYPTION=NO .  
make  
```  

After Building, the witness_node can be launched with:
```  
./programs/witness_node/witness_node  
```  

The node will automatically create a data directory including a config file. It may take several hours to fully synchronize the blockchain. After syncing, you can exit the node using Ctrl+C and setup the command-line wallet by editing witness_node_data_dir/config.ini as follows:

```  
rpc-endpoint = 127.0.0.1:8090  
```  

*notice*ï¼šPlease note that currently(2019-11-19) a full node will need more than 16GB of RAM to operate and required memory is growing fast. Consider the following table as minimal requirements before running a node:

| Default | Full | Minimal  | ElasticSearch 
| --- | --- | --- | ---
| 100G HDD, 16G RAM | 640G SSD, 64G RAM * | 80G HDD, 4G RAM | 500G SSD, 32G RAM

After starting the witness node again, in a separate terminal you can run:  

```  
./programs/cli_wallet/cli_wallet  
```  
Set your inital password:  

```  
>>> set_password <PASSWORD>  
>>> unlock <PASSWORD>  
```  

To import your initial balance:

```  
>>> import_balance <ACCOUNT NAME> [<WIF_KEY>] true  
```  

If you send private keys over this connection, rpc-endpoint should be bound to localhost for security.  
Use help to see all available wallet commands. Source definition and listing of all commands is available [here](https://cn-dev.cocosbcx.io/docs/22-cli_wallet)  

# Using the API  

We provide several different API's.  Each API has its own ID.
When running `witness_node`, initially two API's are available:
API 0 provides read-only access to the database, while API 1 is
used to login and gain access to additional, restricted API's.

Here is an example using `wscat` package from `npm` for websockets:

    $ npm install -g wscat
    $ wscat -c ws://127.0.0.1:8090
    > {"id":1, "method":"call", "params":[0,"get_accounts",[["1.2.0"]]]}
    < {"id":1,"result":[{"id":"1.2.0","annotations":[],"membership_expiration_date":"1969-12-31T23:59:59","registrar":"1.2.0","referrer":"1.2.0","lifetime_referrer":"1.2.0","network_fee_percentage":2000,"lifetime_referrer_fee_percentage":8000,"referrer_rewards_percentage":0,"name":"committee-account","owner":{"weight_threshold":1,"account_auths":[],"key_auths":[],"address_auths":[]},"active":{"weight_threshold":6,"account_auths":[["1.2.5",1],["1.2.6",1],["1.2.7",1],["1.2.8",1],["1.2.9",1],["1.2.10",1],["1.2.11",1],["1.2.12",1],["1.2.13",1],["1.2.14",1]],"key_auths":[],"address_auths":[]},"options":{"memo_key":"GPH1111111111111111111111111111111114T1Anm","voting_account":"1.2.0","num_witness":0,"num_committee":0,"votes":[],"extensions":[]},"statistics":"2.7.0","whitelisting_accounts":[],"blacklisting_accounts":[]}]}

We can do the same thing using an HTTP client such as `curl` for API's which do not require login or other session state:

    $ curl --data '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "call", "params": [0, "get_accounts", [["1.2.0"]]], "id": 1}' http://127.0.0.1:8090/rpc
    {"id":1,"result":[{"id":"1.2.0","annotations":[],"membership_expiration_date":"1969-12-31T23:59:59","registrar":"1.2.0","referrer":"1.2.0","lifetime_referrer":"1.2.0","network_fee_percentage":2000,"lifetime_referrer_fee_percentage":8000,"referrer_rewards_percentage":0,"name":"committee-account","owner":{"weight_threshold":1,"account_auths":[],"key_auths":[],"address_auths":[]},"active":{"weight_threshold":6,"account_auths":[["1.2.5",1],["1.2.6",1],["1.2.7",1],["1.2.8",1],["1.2.9",1],["1.2.10",1],["1.2.11",1],["1.2.12",1],["1.2.13",1],["1.2.14",1]],"key_auths":[],"address_auths":[]},"options":{"memo_key":"GPH1111111111111111111111111111111114T1Anm","voting_account":"1.2.0","num_witness":0,"num_committee":0,"votes":[],"extensions":[]},"statistics":"2.7.0","whitelisting_accounts":[],"blacklisting_accounts":[]}]}

API 0 is accessible using regular JSON-RPC:

    $ curl --data '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "get_accounts", "params": [["1.2.0"]], "id": 1}' http://127.0.0.1:8090/rpc
