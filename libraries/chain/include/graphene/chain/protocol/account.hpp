    * @brief This operation is used to whitelist and blacklist accounts, primarily for transacting in whitelisted assets
    * @ingroup operations
    *
    * Accounts can freely specify opinions about other accounts, in the form of either whitelisting or blacklisting
    * them. This information is used in chain validation only to determine whether an account is authorized to transact
    * in an asset type which enforces a whitelist, but third parties can use this information for other uses as well,
    * as long as it does not conflict with the use of whitelisted assets.
    *
    * An asset which enforces a whitelist specifies a list of accounts to maintain its whitelist, and a list of
    * accounts to maintain its blacklist. In order for a given account A to hold and transact in a whitelisted asset S,
    * A must be whitelisted by at least one of S's whitelist_authorities and blacklisted by none of S's
    * blacklist_authorities. If A receives a balance of S, and is later removed from the whitelist(s) which allowed it
    * to hold S, or added to any blacklist S specifies as authoritative, A's balance of S will be frozen until A's
    * authorization is reinstated.
    *
    * This operation requires authorizing_account's signature, but not account_to_list's. The fee is paid by
    * authorizing_account.
